In order to demonstrate strategic gameplay between a player and the machine, I created the **21 Number Game** in Python. With the rules requiring valid inputs of one to three consecutive digits, I made the game so that the player could clearly choose whether to go first or second. In order to give the computer a competitive edge, I created a function to verify successive number inputs and put logic in place that would allow it to strategically calculate its moves based on the closest multiple of 4. Win/loss conditions are handled dynamically by the game loop, with suitable messages for every situation. My proficiency in Python, algorithm design, and game logic implementation is demonstrated in this project.
